🛠️ Unit Converter
A simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) program written in Python to convert temperature, length, and weight between different units. This project helps you practice functions, loops, error handling, and user input in Python.

📋 Features
Temperature Conversion:
Celsius ↔️ Fahrenheit
Length Conversion:
Meter ↔️ Kilometer ↔️ Mile ↔️ Foot
Weight Conversion:
Kilogram ↔️ Gram ↔️ Pound ↔️ Ounce
Error Handling: Catches invalid inputs and provides user-friendly messages.
Continuous Conversion: Asks if the user wants to perform another conversion.

List of inputs : 
1. Temperature Conversion
2. Length Conversion
3. Weight Conversion
4. Exit
Please choose the type of conversion you would like to perform : 1

1. Fahrenheit ==> Celsius
2. Celsius ==> Fahrenheit
