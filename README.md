🛠️ Unit Converter
A simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) program written in Python to convert temperature, length, and weight between different units. This project helps you practice functions, loops, error handling, and user input in Python.

📋 Features

Temperature Conversion:

Celsius ↔️ Fahrenheit

Length Conversion:

Meter ↔️ Kilometer ↔️ Mile ↔️ Foot

Weight Conversion:

Kilogram ↔️ Gram ↔️ Pound ↔️ Ounce

Error Handling:
Catches invalid inputs and provides user-friendly messages.

Continuous Conversion:
Asks if the user wants to perform another conversion.

🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then follow these steps:

1- Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/C4nix/unit_converter.git
cd unit-converter
```

2- Run the script:

```
python unit_converter.py
```

3- Follow the instructions in the terminal!

📦 Example Usage

```
Welcome to the Unit Converter!

List of inputs : 
1. Temperature Conversion
2. Length Conversion
3. Weight Conversion
4. Exit

Please choose the type of conversion you would like to perform : 1

1. Fahrenheit ==> Celsius
2. Celsius ==> Fahrenheit
 
Which one ? 2

Enter the temperature in Celsius : 100

100.0 °C = 212.0 °F

Would you like to perform another conversion? (yes/no): yes
```



🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

📚 What I Learned

Creating and using functions in Python.

Handling user input and displaying friendly error messages.

Implementing loops and conditionals to manage program flow.

Using try-except blocks for error handling.

🌟 Future Improvements

1- Adding a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt.

2- Supporting more units and types of conversions.

3- Saving conversion history to a file.
